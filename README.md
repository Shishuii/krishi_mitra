It seems like there might be an issue with the provided Colab link or the process described. The link itself could be broken, or the instructions might not be a robust way to share a Colab notebook for this purpose. 

A common and more reliable way to share a Colab notebook is to save a copy to your own Google Drive and then run it from there. This avoids any issues with permissions or the original file being changed.

Here's a revised and more robust description for the Google Colab section.

## ☁️ Running on Google Colab

You can also run this application in a Google Colab environment. This is particularly useful if you don't want to install dependencies locally.

### Step 1: Access the Colab Notebook

1.  Open the Colab notebook by clicking this link: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MJEEPeeh_GsvQJNd4BGHPbvyms06iHoU?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MJEEPeeh_GsvQJNd4BGHPbvyms06iHoU?usp=sharing)
2.  Once the notebook is open, go to `File` > `Save a copy in Drive`. This creates a personal copy of the notebook in your Google Drive, ensuring you have full control over it.

### Step 2: Run the Notebook Cells

1.  In your new copy of the notebook, navigate to `Runtime` > `Run all`.
2.  Follow the instructions within the notebook. This will set up the environment, install the necessary libraries, and start the backend server.
3.  The notebook will use `ngrok` to create a public URL for your server.

### Step 3: Get the ngrok URL

After the notebook has finished running, it will display a public URL (a `ngrok` link). Copy this link.

### Step 4: Update and Open `index.html`

1.  Download the `index.html` file from this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the downloaded `index.html` file in a text editor.
3.  Find the `fetch` part of the code and replace the `localhost` URL with the `ngrok` link you copied from the Colab notebook. For example, change `http://localhost:8000` to `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app`.
4.  Save the `index.html` file.
5.  Open the modified `index.html` file in your web browser to start interacting with the chatbot.
